# Design decisions

## 1. Raymarching, no Three.js

**Decision**: the whole scene compiles to a single GLSL fragment shader, rendered by raymarching signed distance fields (WebGL2).
**Why**: no dependency, a tiny runtime, and organic shapes (smooth unions) that plain rasterization cannot do.
**Accepted limits**: no imported models (GLTF); the cost grows with the number of objects.
**Later**: a WGSL/WebGPU backend, made possible by an intermediate step separate from GLSL.

## 2. Structure lives in `@scene`, not in HTML

**Decision**: objects are declared in a `@scene { cube.corner * 4; }` block.
**Why**: one self-contained file, easy to share and easy for an LLM to generate. No web components.

## 3. Multiplied ids are numbered automatically

**Decision**: `torus#hero * 3` creates `hero-1`, `hero-2`, `hero-3`. Without a multiplier, the id stays `hero`.
**Why**: practical, never a blocking error, and every object stays targetable.

## 4. Specificity: id 10,000, class 100, tag 1

**Decision**: specificity is a single number with widely spaced weights.
**Why**: as in CSS, no realistic number of classes beats an id, and `#hero.big` beats `#hero`.
With equal specificity, the last rule in the file wins.

## 5. Everything that can be computed at compile time is

**Decision**: the cascade, selectors and units (`70deg` → radians) are resolved by the compiler.
The shader only receives final values.
**Why**: a simpler, faster shader; the GPU knows nothing about CSS.

## 6. JavaScript holds the state, the shader draws

**Decision**: the camera, time and, later, hover and animations live in TypeScript
and are sent to the shader as uniforms on every frame.
**Why**: a shader has no memory from one frame to the next.

## 7. One material number per object

**Decision**: each instance has its own number (its index in the scene), used by `getColor`.
**Why**: numbers are always consistent, and every object stays identifiable, which `:hover` will need.

## 8. The AST keeps raw values

**Decision**: the parser stores selectors and values as tokens, without interpreting them.
**Why**: the parser only understands structure; meaning is given later, by the cascade and code generation.

## 9. Angles always have a unit

**Decision**: angles accept `deg`, `rad` and `turn`. Only `0` is accepted without a unit.
**Why**: as in CSS. Without a unit, `1.5` could mean degrees or radians.

## 10. Behavior changes are explicit

**Decision**: any change to how the language behaves comes with an updated test and an entry in this file.
**Why**: the language must never change as a side effect of a code change.

## 11. `@scene` declares, `scene` styles

**Decision**: `@scene { }` declares which objects exist; the `scene { }` rule styles the scene itself (floor, background, and later lights and fog).
Only the exact selector `scene` targets the scene: `.scene`, `#scene` and `scene.big` do not.
**Why**: structure and appearance stay separate, and scene styles benefit from the cascade (`@media`, `var()`, animations).

## 12. Every property is registered

**Decision**: every GSS property is described once, in `src/compiler/registry.ts`.
The compiler rejects unknown properties and properties used in the wrong place.
The reference documentation is generated from the registry, and every example is compiled by the tests.
**Why**: a feature cannot exist without its documentation, and typos are never silently ignored.

## 13. `scale` is uniform

**Decision**: `scale` takes a single positive number, applied on all three axes.
**Why**: a uniform scale keeps distances exact (the distance is multiplied back by the scale). A non-uniform scale would distort the distance field and cause rendering artifacts.

## Open questions

- **Targeting multiplied ids**: should `#hero` target `hero-1`, `hero-2` and `hero-3`?
- **Non-uniform scale**: is `scale: 1 2 1` worth supporting, with an approximate distance?
- **Scene styling**: `:root` could replace `scene { }`, as in CSS, where the root background paints the whole canvas.
